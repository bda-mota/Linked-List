# Linked-List
Compiled of simple functions with linked list and doubly linked list.

In this repository, there are some functions using linked list and doubly linked list. I used CodeVault's videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBZHMkpsTfg&list=PLfqABt5AS4FmXeWuuNDS3XGENJO1VYGxl) as a reference. The codes are mostly the same. My goal was just to have, in a practical way, some basic functions for working with linked lists. I make them available for reference and to help others as well!
